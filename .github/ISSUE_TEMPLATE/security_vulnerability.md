[security@yourdomain.com] before creating a public issue.

## Vulnerability Summary
<!-- Brief, non-detailed description of the security issue -->

## Severity Assessment

- **Impact Level**:
  - [ ] Critical (Complete system compromise)
  - [ ] High (Significant data exposure/system access)
  - [ ] Medium (Limited data exposure/privilege escalation)
  - [ ] Low (Information disclosure/minor security concern)

## Affected Components
<!-- Select all that apply -->
- [ ] Authentication system (token handling, validation)
- [ ] Configuration system (sensitive data storage)
- [ ] MCP server (protocol handling, input validation)
