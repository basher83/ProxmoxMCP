Commit all changes to remote repository. You are REQUIRED to follow these steps in order:

1. Utilize [pre-commit checks](.github/instructions/pre-commit.instructions.md) to ensure
   code quality and standards compliance.

If pre-commit checks fail, fix the issues and re-run the checks before proceeding.
If pre-commit checks pass, proceed to step 2.

2. Utilize [commit instructions](.github/instructions/commit.instructions.md) and commit all changes.
