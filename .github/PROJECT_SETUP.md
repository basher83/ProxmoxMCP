# GitHub Project Board Setup Guide

## Creating the "Proxmox MCP Development Roadmap" Project

### Step 1: Create New Project

1. Go to [ProxmoxMCP repository](https://github.com/basher83/ProxmoxMCP)
2. Click the **"Projects"** tab
3. Click **"New project"**
4. Select **"Board"** template
5. Name: `Proxmox MCP Development Roadmap`
6. Description: `Tracking development progress for Proxmox MCP based on the repository review`

### Step 2: Configure Columns

Create these columns in order:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **To Do** | Tasks that are planned but not yet started |
| **In Progress** | Tasks that are currently being worked on |
| **Review** | Tasks that are completed and awaiting review |
| **Done** | Tasks that are completed and approved |

### Step 3: Add Automation Rules

Configure these automation rules in Project Settings:

#### Issues Automation

- **When issues are opened** → Move to **To Do** column
- **When issues are closed** → Move to **Done** column

#### Pull Requests Automation  

- **When pull requests are opened** → Move to **Review** column
- **When pull requests are merged** → Move to **Done** column

### Step 4: Configure Labels

Ensure these labels are added to the project:

- `bug`
- `enhancement`
- `documentation`
- `security`
- `priority:critical`
- `priority:high`
- `priority:medium`
- `priority:low`

## Populating with Roadmap Items

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Create Issues)

**Issue 1: Implement Token Encryption**

```
Title: [SECURITY] Implement token encryption at rest
Labels: security, priority:critical, component:config, effort:medium
Description:
Implement token encryption for sensitive data in configuration files.

**Implementation:**
- Add cryptography.fernet dependency
- Update src/proxmox_mcp/config/loader.py
- Encrypt tokens before storage
- Add key management system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tokens are encrypted at rest
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism implemented
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Timeline:** 1-2 days
```

**Issue 2: Enable SSL Verification by Default**

```
Title: [SECURITY] Change default SSL verification to true
Labels: security, priority:high, component:config, effort:small
Description:
Change default SSL verification from false to true for security.

**Implementation:**
- Update proxmox-config/config.example.json
- Update documentation to reflect secure defaults
- Add migration guide for existing users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Default verify_ssl changed to true
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Migration guide created

**Timeline:** Few hours
```

**Issue 3: Add VM Command Validation**

```
Title: [SECURITY] Implement VM command validation and sanitization
Labels: security, priority:critical, component:tools, effort:medium
Description:
Add input validation and sanitization for VM commands to prevent injection attacks.

**Implementation:**
- Add command whitelist/validation in src/proxmox_mcp/tools/vm.py
- Implement command sanitization with shlex
- Add command execution limits
- Add audit logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Command validation implemented
- [ ] Sanitization prevents injection
- [ ] Audit logging added
- [ ] Tests for security edge cases

**Timeline:** 1-2 days
```

### Phase 2: Docker Improvements (Create Issues)

**Issue 4: Enhance Docker Security**

```
Title: [DOCKER] Implement Docker security best practices
Labels: security, priority:high, component:docker, effort:medium
Description:
Enhance Docker container security with non-root user and security practices.

**Implementation:**
- Run container as non-root from start
- Implement Docker secrets
- Add resource limits and health checks
- Update documentation

**Timeline:** 1 day
```

### Phase 3: Error Handling (Create Issues)

**Issue 5: Create Exception Hierarchy**

```
Title: [ENHANCEMENT] Implement ProxmoxMCP-specific exception classes
Labels: enhancement, priority:medium, component:tools, effort:small
Description:
Create specific exception classes for better error handling and debugging.

**Timeline:** 1 day
```

**Issue 6: Add Health Check Tool**

```
Title: [ENHANCEMENT] Add health check endpoint for monitoring
Labels: enhancement, priority:medium, component:server, effort:small
Description:
Add health check tool for monitoring server and Proxmox connection status.

**Timeline:** 1 day
```

## Quick Setup Commands

### Using GitHub CLI (if available)

```bash
# Create project (requires GitHub CLI with projects extension)
gh project create --title "Proxmox MCP Development Roadmap" --body "Tracking development progress for Proxmox MCP"

# Add labels to repository (run from .github directory)
./setup-labels.sh
```

### Manual Setup

Follow the web interface steps above, then manually create issues based on the roadmap phases.

## Project Management Best Practices

### Issue Creation Guidelines

1. **Use descriptive titles** with prefixes: [SECURITY], [ENHANCEMENT], [DOCKER], etc.
2. **Add appropriate labels** for priority, component, and effort
3. **Include acceptance criteria** for clear completion definition
4. **Set realistic timelines** based on complexity
5. **Link related issues** using "Related to #X" or "Blocks #Y"

### Board Management

1. **Weekly review** of board status and priorities
2. **Move cards promptly** as work progresses
3. **Update issue descriptions** with progress notes
4. **Close completed issues** with summary of changes

### Automation Benefits

- **Automatic card movement** based on issue/PR lifecycle
- **Consistent labeling** for better organization
- **Progress tracking** without manual overhead
- **Team coordination** with clear status visibility

**Next Steps:**

1. Create the GitHub Project board using the web interface
2. Configure automation rules as described
3. Create initial issues for Phase 1 (Critical Security Fixes)
4. Begin implementing security improvements
5. Regular board reviews and updates
