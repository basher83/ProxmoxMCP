# Milestones Management Guide for ProxmoxMCP

## 🎯 What Milestones Should Represent

**Milestones should be:**

- **Release-focused**: Tied to specific software releases (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- **Time-bound**: Have clear due dates
- **Goal-oriented**: Represent meaningful project achievements
- **User-facing**: Deliver value to end users

**Examples for ProxmoxMCP:**

- `v1.0.0 - Stable Release`
- `v1.1.0 - Enhanced Security`
- `v2.0.0 - Breaking Changes`
- `Q3 2025 - Performance Improvements`

## 📋 Milestone Planning Best Practices

### 1. **Use Semantic Versioning**

```
v1.0.0 - Major release
v1.1.0 - Minor features  
v1.0.1 - Bug fixes
```

### 2. **Set Realistic Due Dates**

- Based on team capacity and complexity
- Allow buffer time for testing and documentation
- Review and adjust dates as needed

### 3. **Scope Appropriately**

- **Small milestones** (2-4 weeks): 5-15 issues
- **Medium milestones** (1-2 months): 15-30 issues
- **Large milestones** (quarterly): 30+ issues

### 4. **Balance Issue Types**

```
Typical milestone composition:
- 60% Features/Enhancements
- 25% Bug fixes
- 10% Documentation
- 5% Technical debt
```

```

### 2. **Issue Assignment**

- Assign issues during sprint planning
- Use labels to categorize: `priority:high`, `effort:medium`
- Review assignments weekly

### 3. **Progress Tracking**

- Monitor completion percentage
- Identify blockers early
- Adjust scope if needed

### 4. **Release Preparation**

- 90% complete: Feature freeze
- 95% complete: Code freeze
- 100% complete: Release and close milestone

## 🎛️ Milestone vs. Projects vs. Labels

| Feature | Use For | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Milestones** | Release planning | v1.0.0, v1.1.0 |
| **Projects** | Workflow tracking | "Development Roadmap" |
| **Labels** | Categorization | `bug`, `enhancement`, `priority:high` |

## 📈 Tracking and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Burn-down rate**: Issues closed over time
- **Scope creep**: Issues added after milestone start
- **Velocity**: Average issues completed per week
- **Quality**: Bug rate in releases

### GitHub Insights

- Use milestone progress bar
- Filter issues by milestone
- Generate release notes from closed issues
