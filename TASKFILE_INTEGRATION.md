## üéØ Usage Examples

### Starting New Work

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
task work:start
# This will:
# 1. Guide you through branch creation
# 2. Set up development environment
# 3. Show next steps

# Or create specific branch types directly
task branch:feature -- "add-vm-monitoring-tools" 123
task branch:fix -- "memory-leak-connection-pool" 58
task branch:security -- "fix-shell-injection"
```

### During Development

```bash
# Save your work (quality checks + commit guidance)
task work:save

# Check if your branch is ready for PR
task branch:ready

# Validate your branch name
task branch:validate

# See all your branches
task branch:list
```

### Finishing Work

```bash
# Complete your work and get PR guidance
task work:finish

# Check branch status
task branch:status

# Sync with main if needed
task branch:sync
```

### Quality Assurance Integration

```bash
# The branch:ready task combines:
task branch:ready
# - Branch name validation
# - All code quality checks (format, lint, type)
# - Test execution
# - YAML validation
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Tasks

The new branch tasks work seamlessly with your existing workflow:

```bash
# Combined workflow example
task work:start                    # Create branch + setup
# ... make your changes ...
task quick                         # Format + lint + test (existing task)
task work:save                     # Quality check + commit helper
task work:finish                   # Final checks + PR guidance

# Or step by step
task branch:feature -- "new-api" 123
task setup                         # Existing setup task
# ... development work ...
task check                         # Existing quality checks
task branch:ready                  # New: combines validation + checks
```

## üé® Task Features

### Command Line Arguments

```bash
# Feature branches with issue numbers
task branch:feature -- "add-monitoring" 123
task branch:feature -- "improve-performance"

# Fix branches
task branch:fix -- "connection-timeout" 58
task branch:fix -- "null-pointer-exception"

# Security branches
task branch:security -- "cve-2025-47273-fix"
task branch:security -- "input-validation"

# Release branches
task branch:release -- "v1.0.0"
task branch:release -- "v1.1.0-beta"

# Branch validation
task branch:check -- "feature/123-my-branch"
task branch:check -- "invalid-branch-name"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Guided experience for beginners
task branch
# This opens the interactive branch creator with:
# - Branch type selection
# - Description input
# - Issue number linking
# - Confirmation and guidance
```

### Status and Information

```bash
# Show current branch and git status
task branch:status

# List all branches with commit info
task branch:list

# Show project information including branch
task info
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

```bash
# Create your own workflow combinations
task branch:feature -- "new-tool" 123 && task setup && task dev

# Check everything before creating PR
task branch:ready && echo "Ready for PR!"

# Quick branch creation and immediate development
task work:start && code .
```

### Git Integration

```bash
# The tasks handle git operations automatically:
# - Update main branch before creating new branches
# - Push branches with upstream tracking
# - Provide git commands for manual operations

# Branch cleanup (shows commands to run)
task branch:clean
# Output: Commands to delete merged branches
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Local CI simulation with branch validation
task ci && task branch:validate

# Pre-commit workflow
task pre-commit && task branch:ready
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modifying Tasks

You can customize the branch tasks by editing the Taskfile.yml:

```yaml
# Example: Add your own branch workflow
custom:workflow:
  desc: My custom workflow
  cmds:
    - task: branch:feature
    - task: setup
    - task: test
    - echo "Custom workflow complete!"
```

### Environment Variables

The tasks respect your existing environment:

```yaml
env:
  PYTHONPATH: "src:{{.PYTHONPATH}}"  # Existing
  # Branch scripts use git configuration automatically
```

## üìä Task List Integration

The new tasks are organized in the task list:

```bash
task --list
```

Shows organized sections:

- **Branch Management**: All branch-related tasks
- **Development Setup**: Existing setup tasks
- **Code Quality**: Existing quality tasks
- **Testing**: Existing test tasks
- etc.

## üîÑ Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

All your existing tasks remain unchanged:

- ‚úÖ `task setup` - Still works exactly the same
- ‚úÖ `task quick` - No changes to existing workflow
- ‚úÖ `task check` - All quality checks unchanged
- ‚úÖ `task ci` - CI simulation unchanged

### New Dependencies

The branch tasks only require:

- Git (already required for your project)
- Bash (standard on macOS/Linux)
- The branch template scripts (included)

No additional dependencies needed!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Task not found:**

```bash
# Make sure integration completed
task --list | grep branch

# If not found, re-run integration
./scripts/branch-templates/integrate-taskfile.sh
```

**Branch script not executable:**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/branch-templates/*.sh
```

**Git errors:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the git repository
git status

# Check if main branch exists
git branch -a
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show all available tasks
task --list

# Show task description
task --summary branch:feature

# Show project info including current branch
task info

# Validate current setup
task branch:validate
```

## üéâ Quick Start Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Essential commands for daily use
task branch                        # Create new branch (interactive)
task work:start                    # Start new work (create + setup)
task work:save                     # Save work (check + commit help)
task work:finish                   # Finish work (ready + PR guide)

# Quick branch creation
task branch:feature -- "desc" 123  # Feature with issue
task branch:fix -- "desc" 58      # Fix with issue
task branch:hotfix -- "desc"      # Emergency fix

# Quality and validation
task branch:ready                  # Check if ready for PR
task quick                         # Fast quality check (existing)
task check                         # Full quality check (existing)

# Status and management
task branch:status                 # Current branch info
task branch:list                   # All branches overview
task info                          # Project + branch info
```

This integration makes branch management a natural part of your existing Task workflow while
maintaining all the power and flexibility of your current setup!
