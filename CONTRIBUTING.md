## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate of others when contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerized development)
- Proxmox VE instance (for testing)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProxmoxMCP.git
   cd ProxmoxMCP
   ```

2. Set up git configuration for development:

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Copy project git configuration (recommended)
   cp example.gitconfig .git/config

   # Then update with your personal details
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

   # Option 2: Manual configuration
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config core.editor "vscode"
   git config init.defaultBranch "main"
   git config pull.rebase true
   git config push.autoSetupRemote true
   ```

   The `example.gitconfig` includes development-friendly settings like:

   - Python/JSON/Dockerfile diff patterns
   - Useful aliases (`git lg`, `git st`, `git sync`)
   - Performance and security optimizations

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. Configure your Proxmox connection:

   ```bash
   cp proxmox-config/config.example.json proxmox-config/config.json
   # Edit config.json with your Proxmox credentials
   ```

## Contribution Workflow

1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/ProxmoxMCP/issues) for tasks to work on or create a new issue for your proposed change
2. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Run the tests to ensure they pass:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

6. Update documentation as needed
7. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

8. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

9. Create a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository

## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Code Formatting

We use the following tools for code formatting and linting:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

You can run these tools with:

```bash
black src tests
isort src tests
flake8 src tests
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for high test coverage of your code
- Include both positive and negative test cases

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

For coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=src
```

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changes to functionality
- Document all public APIs
- Include examples where appropriate
- Keep the README up to date
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules

## Issue and Pull Request Process

### Issues

- Use the appropriate issue template
- Provide clear and detailed information
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs
- Label issues appropriately

### Pull Requests

- Reference the related issue in your pull request
- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass
- Request review from maintainers

## Security Vulnerabilities
