For all commits to github follow the ProxmoxMCP commit message format defined in the 
@.gitmessage file when generating commit messages.

Follow these steps exactly when making a commit:

1. Execute `git status` to verify if the current branch is up to date with origin/main
2. Pull latest changes from main branch if needed and resolve any conflicts.
3. Stage your changes using `git add <file>` or `git add .` for all files.
4. Commit using the repos .gitmessage template.
5. Push your changes to main branch.
