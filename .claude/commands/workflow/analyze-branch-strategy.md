# Branch analysis

Comprehensive branch analysis and merge strategy workflow: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow systematically analyzes all branches to optimize merge strategy and maintain
branch purpose alignment. Execute each phase methodically and maintain detailed analysis
throughout.

**IMPORTANT**: Always verify branch analysis against current GitHub state to ensure accuracy.

## Phase 1: Branch Discovery and Initial Assessment

Step 1.1: **Enumerate All Branches (Local and Remote)**

```bash
# Get all local branches with last commit info
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate) %(authorname) %(subject)' refs/heads/ --sort=-committerdate

# Get all remote branches
git branch -r

# Verify against GitHub API for authoritative branch list
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches | jq '.[].name'
```

Step 1.2: **Cross-Reference Local vs Remote State**

- Compare local branch list with GitHub remote branches
- Identify any stale local branches that no longer exist on GitHub
- Note discrepancies that may indicate outdated local state
- Focus on branches that exist on GitHub (authoritative source)

Step 1.3: **Identify Active Development Branches**

- Focus on branches modified within the last 30 days
- Exclude main/master and any deployment branches
- Note branch naming patterns (feature/, bugfix/, chore/, etc.)
- Verify branch existence on GitHub before detailed analysis

Step 1.4: **Create Branch Analysis Matrix**
For each GitHub-verified branch, create an initial assessment:

- Branch name and inferred purpose
- Last activity date and author
- Commit count vs main
- Estimated complexity (file count in diff)
- GitHub branch status confirmation

## Phase 2: Detailed Diff Analysis Per Branch

For each GitHub-verified branch identified in Phase 1, perform comprehensive analysis:

Step 2.1: **Verify Branch Exists and Get Complete Diff Against Main**

```bash
# First verify branch exists on GitHub
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/BRANCH_NAME || echo "Branch not found on GitHub"

# For each verified branch, get detailed diff
git diff main..BRANCH_NAME --name-status
git diff main..BRANCH_NAME --stat
git log main..BRANCH_NAME --oneline

# Check if branch has associated PRs
gh pr list --head BRANCH_NAME
```

Step 2.2: **Categorize Changes by Type**
Analyze each changed file and categorize:

A. **Infrastructure/Tooling Changes**

- Build configuration (package.json, Dockerfile, CI/CD)
- Linting rules, formatters, type definitions
- Development tooling and scripts
- Documentation updates (README, CONTRIBUTING)

B. **Code Quality Improvements**

- Refactoring without functional changes
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling improvements
- Code style consistency fixes
- Security enhancements

C. **Feature-Specific Implementation**

- New functionality directly related to branch purpose
- Feature-specific tests and documentation
- API changes specific to the feature
- Feature-specific configuration

D. **Bug Fixes**

- General bug fixes unrelated to feature
- Feature-specific bug fixes

Step 2.3: **Cross-Reference with Branch Purpose**
For each branch, extract the intended purpose from:

- Branch name (feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration)
- Initial commit messages
- Any associated issues or PRs
- Code changes that clearly indicate intent

## Phase 3: Merge Strategy Analysis

Step 3.1: **Immediate Merge Candidates**
Identify changes that should be merged to main immediately:

**High-Priority Immediate Merge:**

- Critical bug fixes affecting main branch
- Security improvements
- CI/CD fixes that benefit all development
- Linting/formatting rule updates
- Documentation improvements
- Development tooling enhancements

**Medium-Priority Immediate Merge:**

- Code quality refactoring with no functional impact
- Performance optimizations in shared code
- Test infrastructure improvements
- Configuration management improvements

Step 3.2: **Branch-Specific Retention**
Changes that should remain in feature branch:

- Incomplete feature implementations
- Feature-specific tests for unreleased functionality
- Experimental code or work-in-progress
- Breaking changes that require coordination
- Feature-specific documentation for unreleased features

Step 3.3: **Anomaly Detection and Stale Branch Identification**
Flag branches with concerning patterns:

- Feature branches with extensive unrelated changes
- Old branches with changes that should have been merged
- Branches with conflicting approaches to same problem
- Branches that might have merge conflicts
- **Stale local branches**: Local branches that no longer exist on GitHub
- **Analysis report inconsistencies**: Branches mentioned in previous reports but missing from GitHub

## Phase 4: Strategic Recommendations

Step 4.1: **Generate Merge Recommendations**
For each branch, create specific recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action Items:**
   - List specific files/changes for immediate cherry-pick to main
   - Estimated effort and risk assessment
   - Suggested PR title and description

2. **Branch Continuation Strategy:**
   - What should remain in the branch
   - Estimated completion timeline
   - Dependencies and blockers

3. **Branch Hygiene Improvements:**
   - Suggestions for better branch management
   - Recommended rebasing or cleanup actions

Step 4.2: **Create Implementation Plan**
Generate a prioritized action plan:

```markdown
## Branch Analysis Summary

### Immediate Merge Queue (Priority Order)
1. [Branch Name] - [Specific Changes] - [Estimated Effort]
2. [Branch Name] - [Specific Changes] - [Estimated Effort]

### Cherry-Pick Candidates
- Branch: feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration
  - Files for immediate merge: eslint.config.js, .github/workflows/quality.yml
  - Reason: Linting improvements benefit all development
  - Action: Create PR "Improve linting configuration from feature branch"

### Branch Continuation Recommendations
- Branch: feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration
  - Keep: src/mcp-integration/, tests/mcp/, docs/mcp-integration.md
  - Estimated completion: 2-3 weeks
  - Blockers: API design finalization

### Branch Hygiene Actions
- [Branch Name]: Rebase against current main, resolve conflicts
- [Branch Name]: Consider splitting into smaller focused branches
```

## Phase 5: Execution and Automation

Step 5.1: **Create Automated Actions**
Generate specific git commands for immediate execution:

```bash
# Example cherry-pick operations
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b chore/quality-improvements-from-feature-branches

# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick -x [commit-hash] # Quality improvements from feature/branch-a
git cherry-pick -x [commit-hash] # Documentation from feature/branch-b
```

Step 5.2: **Integration with Project Automation**
Create follow-up actions that integrate with your existing CI/CD:

- Generate GitHub issues for immediate merge PRs
- Create tracking issues for branch completion
- Update project documentation with branch status
- Schedule follow-up branch analysis

## Phase 6: Reporting and Documentation

Step 6.1: **Create Comprehensive Report**
Generate detailed report including:

- Executive summary of findings
- **GitHub branch verification status**
- Branch-by-branch analysis (GitHub-verified only)
- **Stale branch cleanup recommendations**
- Immediate action items with timelines
- Long-term branch strategy recommendations
- Metrics: lines of code, file changes, estimated merge complexity
- **Discrepancy analysis**: Previous reports vs current GitHub state

Step 6.2: **Update Project Documentation**

- Update @CONTRIBUTING.md with branch management insights
- Create or update branch strategy documentation
- Document any new processes discovered during analysis

## Special Considerations for ProxmoxMCP Project

**Domain-Specific Analysis:**

- Ensure MCP server changes stay in appropriate branches
- Verify Proxmox API integration changes align with feature goals
- Check that configuration examples match their intended branches
- Validate that documentation updates correspond to feature completeness

**Quality Automation Integration:**

- Leverage your existing pytest && black . && mypy . && ruff check . pipeline
- Consider how immediate merges affect your GitHub automation workflows
- Ensure changes don't break your claude-issue-assignment automation

**Security and Configuration Review:**

- Pay special attention to authentication and API key handling changes
- Review any Proxmox configuration changes for security implications
- Ensure MCP server configurations are properly scoped

## Report Generation and Storage

Step 6.1: **Create Report Directory Structure**

```bash
# Create reports directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/reports/branch-analysis
```

Step 6.2: **Generate Timestamped Report**
Save the complete analysis to a timestamped file:

**Report Location:** @.claude/reports/branch-analysis/

Example: `.claude/reports/branch-analysis/branch-analysis-20241217-143022.md`

Step 6.3: **Create Current Analysis Symlink**

```bash
# Create symlink to latest report for easy access
ln -sf branch-analysis-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md .claude/reports/branch-analysis/latest.md
```

## Output Format

Save the analysis in this structured format to the report file:

```markdown
