Comprehensive Proxmox troubleshooting workflow: $ARGUMENTS

This is a multi-step troubleshooting workflow. Work through each step systematically:

**Phase 1: Information Gathering**

- Get cluster status and node health
- Check VM status and resource allocation
- Review recent logs and alerts

**Phase 2: Problem Analysis**  

- Correlate symptoms with known Proxmox issues
- Check resource constraints (CPU, memory, storage)
- Validate network connectivity and performance

**Phase 3: Solution Implementation**

- Apply appropriate fixes based on findings
- Document changes made
- Verify resolution and system stability

**Phase 4: Prevention**

- Update monitoring and alerting if needed
- Document lessons learned
- Update troubleshooting documentation

Work through this systematically, asking for confirmation before making changes.
